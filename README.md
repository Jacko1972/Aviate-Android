Aviate is an App that can be used by aviators, or meteorological enthusiasts to gain immediate information provided by Aerodromes and Heliports from around the globe. App provides a Flight Plan feature to list all the data from AD/HPs you provide, AD/HP Search where you can search by a partial name to get the details about the Station and its current weather data, the Around Me feature shows TAFs or METARs on a map, the map can be filtered using distance from current location and the map type can changed.

## Project Overview
In the Capstone project, you will build an app of your own design in two stages. In Stage 1, you will design and plan the app, using a template that we provide in the "Instructions" node.

Creating and building your own app idea can be both exciting and daunting; ultimately, we want the experience to be rewarding. You'll apply a wealth of different concepts and components that you've learned across the Nanodegree to bring you own app idea to life.

To keep the process from becoming overwhelming (or simply chaotic), you will design and plan your app, and receive feedback, before you start building. This will help prevent and mitigate pain points you might run into along the way, and also replicates the process of professional Android Developers.

## Why this Project?
To become a proficient Android Developer, you need to design apps and make plans for how to implement them. This will involve choices such as how you will store data, how you will display data to the user, and what functionality to include in the app.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:

* An app description
* UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects, like the Popular Movies overview
* A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order

The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.
